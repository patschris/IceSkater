# Iceskater Scene
The program needs exactly two integers as arguments. Specifically:
- *L*: lake's length
- *Dist*: the distance that iceskater glides. 

This exercise is a training at constructors and destructors in case of class composition and at class accessibility and scope. The scene consists of a background, a lake and an iceskater. In the scene, a show is demonstrated. The show is implemented at the function plot. The background consists of mountains, trees and a little house. The iceskater contains the information about the gliding distance (*distance*) and the distance from the edge of the lake (*position*).<br/>

**Assumption**: the lake is rectangular and the iceskater is moving along the rectangular base.<br/>

**Makefile** 
- `make` to compile
- `make clean` to delete the object files and the executable.<br/>
