# Iceskater Scene
Written in C++, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. The program needs exactly two integers as arguments. Specifically, L: lake's length, Dist: the distance that iceskater glides. Contains makefile: make to compile and make clean to delete object files and executable. This exercise is a training at constructors and destructors in case of class composition and at class accessibility and scope. The scene consists of a background, a lake and an iceskater. In the scene, a show is demonstrated. The show is implemented at the function plot. The background consists of mountains, trees and a little house. The iceskater contains the information about the gliding distance (distance) and the distance from the edge of the lake (position). Let's assume that the lake is rectangular and the iceskater is moving along the rectangular base.
